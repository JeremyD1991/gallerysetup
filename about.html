						<h2>A brief history about me</h2>
						<p>I am Jeremy Williams – a professional and freelance photographer, designer, coder, and digital media manager living in Greenville, South Carolina. I started JDW Creative to help others with creative and unique projects while developing my skills and connections. As a student and professional, I gained a deep understanding of every facet of the creative process through my various roles. This understanding allows me to combine the best quality with efficient turnaround times.<br><br>

						My drive and adaptability set me apart from others. Starting out as a layout staff for my high school yearbook, I quickly learned how to manage my assignments and learn from mistakes. During college, I led the yearbook staff as editor, taught other students, and specialized in visual communications. After graduation I became the project lead for a database migration and taught myself how to code. This ability to learn and grow led me to my latest role as a digital media manager. In this role, I create and plan mass marketing email campaigns, created and maintain websites, photograph or record various events, work on various design projects, and process digital analytics data.<br><br>

						Seeking new challenges and projects is a great way for me to continue to explore and grow as a person and a professional. Below you will find more details about my specific skills broken down by category. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me here.

					<h2>Photography</h2>
					<h4 style="color: #ececec;">Engagements / Portraits / Profiles / Concerts / Events / Performances / Venues / Nature</h4>
					<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;">Initially, I was only interested in graphic design, but photography caught my eye during my sophomore year in college. I quickly learned how to operate the camera, what each setting did, how to compose shots, and how valuable good lighting is. I now have over 7 years of photography experience and often take photos of events and venues for a local performing arts center. Whether it’s a posed portrait or a dancer jumping through the air, I’ve learned how to capture the perfect moment in a photograph.</p>

					<h2>Design & Production</h2>
					<h4 style="color: #ececec;">Layouts / Logos / Ads / Brochures / Books / Invitations / Business Cards / Billboards</h4>
					<p style="margin: 0 0 30px;">Graphic design is where it all started for me. In high school, I started out laying out class pages in yearbook and became the layout editor for the school newspaper. During college, I joined yearbook and served as editor for 3 years. As the yearbook editor, I led the yearbook staff, planned how the book would layout, the designs for the cover and pages, edited photos, and created graphics and copy for each section. I currently work with a performing arts center to create media for their events and marketing campaigns.</p>

					<h2>Digital</h2>
					<h4 style="color: #ececec;">HTML / CSS / jQuery / JavaScript / Content Management / Email Marketing / Analytics</h4>
					<p>I stumbled into an opportunity to become a digital media manager shortly after graduating from college. I taught myself HTML and CSS in order to be the best candidate for the position.

					Once I was the digital media manager, I oversaw the creation of mass marketing email campaigns and website content. After improving the site, I implemented tracking to track digital marketing efforts. Once analytics were in place, I learned JavaScript and jQuery and used this knowledge to create a separate venue rental site, a media center for upcoming events, and a board of trustees web portal for the performing arts center.
